        <p>This is a man's world, this is a man's world</p>
        <p>But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl</p>
        <br>
        <p>You see, man made the cars to take us over the road</p>
        <p>Man made the train to carry the heavy load</p>
        <p>Man made electric light to take us out of the dark</p>
        <p>Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is a man's, man's, man's world</p>
        <p>But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl</p>
        <br>
        <p>Man thinks about our little bitty baby girls and our baby boys</p>
        <p>Man made them <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">happy</span>, 'cause man made them toys</p>
        <p>And after man make everything, everything he can</p>
        <p>You know that man makes money, to buy from other man</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is a man's world</p>
        <p>But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, not one little thing, without a woman or a girl</p>
        <p>He's lost in the wilderness</p>
        <p>He's lost in bitterness, he's lost lost</p>
